An open source publication is being planned as well as the publication of a
paper. Until then, we request that publications derived from the use of
MATGASFLOW explicitly acknowledge that fact by citing the the software as
follows:

    Marcel Kurth (2021). matGasFlow (Version 0.0.2) [Software]. Institute for
        High Voltage Equipment and Grids, Digitalization and Energy
        Economics (IAEW), RWTH Aachen University.

In the interest of facilitating research reproducibility and thereby
increasing the value of your MATGASFLOW-related research publications, we
strongly encourage you to also publish, whenever possible, all of the
code and data required to generate the results you are publishing.
