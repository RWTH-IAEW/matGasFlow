An open source publication is being planned as well as the publication of a
paper. Until then, we request that publications derived from the use of
matGasFlow, or the included data files, explicitly acknowledge that fact by
citing the software, dissertation, or paper as follows:

Software:
    Marcel Kurth (2024). matGasFlow (Version 1.0) [Software]. Institute for
        High Voltage Equipment and Grids, Digitalization and Energy
        Economics (IAEW), RWTH Aachen University. Available:
        https://github.com/RWTH-IAEW/matGasFlow

Disseration:
    Marcel Kurth, "Blending Hydrogen into Natural Gas Networks - Assessing
        Gas Model Inaccuracies and Improving Steady-State Gas Flow
        Calculation Methods". Doctoral Thesis, RWTH Aachen University, 2024

Paper:
    Kurth, Marcel; Braun, Marie-Sophie Heidi; Ulbig, Andreas: "Impact of
        Substituting Hydrogen for Natural Gas on Compressor Station
        Operation in Gas Networks". In: 2023 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid
        Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe). IEEE. 2023

In the interest of facilitating research reproducibility and thereby
increasing the value of your matGasFlow-related research publications, we
encourage you to publish, whenever possible, the code and data required to
generate the results you are publishing.
