Publications and citing matGasFlow
----------------------------------
An open source publication is being planned as well as the publication of a
paper. Until then, we request that publications derived from the use of
matGasFlow explicitly acknowledge that fact by citing the the software as
follows:

    Marcel Kurth (2022). matGasFlow [Software]. Institute for High Voltage
        Equipment and Grids, Digitalization and Energy Economics (IAEW),
        RWTH Aachen University.

In the interest of facilitating research reproducibility and thereby
increasing the value of your matGasFlow-related research publications, we
strongly encourage you to also publish, whenever possible, all of the
code and data required to generate the results you are publishing.
